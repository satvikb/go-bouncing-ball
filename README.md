# About
This it my submission for SwampHacks 2023. This was mostly to learn about Go and how to use the SDL2 Go wrapper to display a game running on a tick system.

# Install
Install SDL2 on your computer. Then move the `SDL2.dll` and `SDL2_ttf.dll` to this root folder.
Then run `go build` and execute `app.exe` to run the project
